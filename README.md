# Strong-D Analysis

This repository contains analysis of data from the [Strong-D study](http://med.stanford.edu/discover/research/strong-d.html) and the working paper that is based on this analysis (see "Paper" directory). Specifically, the following hypotheses will be explored:

1. Resting HR (RHR) changes over time during course of study
    1. (Define RHR)
    2. As participants’ fitness level increases, their RHR decreases
    3. Participants in the aerobic activity study arm see a larger drop in RHR than those in the strength-training study arm. those in the strength-training study arm.
  
2. HR recovery after exercise changes over time during course of study
    1. HR recovery change is greater for participants in the aerobic activity study arm than those in the strength-training study arm.
3. Physical activity (PA) activity changes over time during course of study
    1. Participants change their physical activity levels only in accordance with the study guidelines over the course of the study (no more or less activity than was prescribed). – (i.e. physical activity levels from the Fitbit correspond with times participants checked into 24 hour fitness- there are no other high bouts of PA outside of the 24 hour fitness check-ins, and PA is high after 24-hour fitness check in).
4. Can we predict whether someone is currently doing a strength training vs aerobic activity from a combination of their HR + accelerometer data?
