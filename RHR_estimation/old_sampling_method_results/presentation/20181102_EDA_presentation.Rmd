## Strong-D Study
Strength Training Regimen for Normal Weight Diabetics

- Goal: determine the best exercise regimen for normal weight participants with Type 2 Diabetes
  - Manipulated variables: strength vs aerobic vs combined exercises
  - Response variable: blood sugar levels
- Data:
  - Fitbit: frequent measurements, e.g. per second raw heart rate
  - iPad sign-in data, e.g. study arm data
  - Clinical + demographics data, e.g. weight, race

## Participants

## Background: Diabetes
- Elevated levels of blood glucose (hyperglycemia) 
- Insulin signals cells to absorb glucose from the blood
- Type 1 diabetes: impaired insulin production
- **Type 2 diabetes**: insulin resistance
- Lifestyle interventions, e.g. exercise

## Background: Resting Heart Rate (RHR) and Fitness
- "a higher average number of steps per day is associated with lower resting HR"

**Want: Decreasing RHR over the course of the study.**

## Big Ideas Lab Hypothesis
### Current Hypothesis: How does Resting Heart Rate (RHR) change over time?
- Correlation with fitness level (to be investigated)
- Compare across study arms

# How does Resting Heart Rate (RHR) change over time?

## Data Preprocessing
![Data preprocessing flowchart.](images/preprocessing_flow.png)

## EDA: Resting Heart Rate, Time, Exercise Intensity Level
How do we _define_ RHR?

1. Fitbit's calculation of RHR
2. Raw (per second) heart rate values at sedentary intensity level 
  - 0: sedentary, 1: light, 2: moderate, 3: very active
  - Intensity levels are calculated by Fitbit

Limitations of these definitions?

To be investigated:

- Raw heart rate values during time periods with infrequent steps

# Proposed RHR Definition 1: Fitbit's Calculation

## Def 1: RHR per Day per Study Arm
![RHR (calculated by Fitbit) per day, faceted by study arm.](../plots/RHR_fitbit_perArm.png)

- Each color represents a different participant (79)
  - Better use of colors?
- **Limitation: missing values**

## Def 1: Median RHR per Day per Study Arm
![Median RHR per day, faceted by study arm.](../plots/medianRHR_fitbit_perArm.png)

- Median line for each study arm plot from the previous slide
- Trend does not suggest decreasing RHR

# Proposed Definition 2: Raw (per second) heart rate values at sedentary intensity level

## Def 2: Heart Rate per Intensity Level
- Advantage: raw per second HR data has no missing values!

## Def 2: Heart Rate per Intensity Level per Study Arm
![HR per intensity level, faceted by study arm.](../plots/HR_perIntensity_perArm_boxplot.png){height=70%}

- Outliers (absolute distance $>1.5*IQR$ from the 1st or 3rd quartile)

## Def 2: RHR per Second per Study Arm
![RHR (sedentary intensity) per second for a few participants, faceted by study arm.](../plots/RHR_intensity0_perSecond.png){height=50%}

- Limitations: 
  - Noise
  - Not possible to plot all participants
- Aggregation

## Def 2: Minimum RHR per Day per Study Arm
![Min. RHR (sedentary intensity) per day, faceted by study arm.](../plots/minRHR_intensity0_perDay_perArm.png)

- Minimum could be an outlier

## Def 2: Lower Quartile RHR per Day per Study Arm
![Lower quartile RHR (sedentary intensity) per day, faceted by study arm.](../plots/quart1RHR_intensity0_perDay_perArm.png)

- Outliers
- No decreasing trend

## Def 2: Limitations
- Outliers
- Intensity levels are calculated by Fitbit
  - Proprietary algorithm
  - Possibly calculated with HR values --> what does it mean to relate intensity and HR?

## Next Steps
### Address Limitations
- Fitbit calculations
- Outlier removal
- Revise RHR definition
  - Raw heart rate values during time periods with infrequent steps

### Fitness Level
- Correlation between RHR and fitness level
