## Strong-D
Stanford's STRONG-D Study: Strength Training Regimen for Normal Weight Diabetics

- Goal: determine the best exercise regimen for normal weight participants with Type 2 Diabetes
  - Manipulated variables: strength vs aerobic vs combined exercises
  - Response variable: indirect measures of blood sugar levels (hemoglobin A1c)
  
## Strong-D Data

\end{table}

- Fitbit data: 423 days of measurements for 78 participants from August 1, 2017 to September 28, 2018
  
## Goal and Motivation
Build a machine learning model for classifying aerobic vs strength using wrist-worn, PPG-based Fitbit Charge 2 data.

- Convenience: wrist-worn, consumer product
- Estimate number of minutes for performing a type of activity
  - Study compliance
  - Weekly adult lifestyle guidelines (WHO): >150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity, >2 days with muscle-strengthening activities
- Determine which type of activity is occuring at which timestamp
  - Extract biomarkers according to the type of activity
  - Caveat: some biomarkers are used as features
- Feature engineering based on background literature and EDA
  - I hope that you all can help me brainstorm features throughout this presentation :)

## Accelerometers for Classifying Activity Type
```{r, out.width='2in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Wrist and hip accelerometers."}
knitr::include_graphics('images/wrist_hip_accelerometer.png')
```

- Wrist, hip, ankle
- Static vs dynamic acceleration
  - 1g = 9.8 $\text{m/s}^2$
  - 1-3 axes
- 20–30 Hz

## Accelerometers for Classifying Activity Type
```{r, out.width='4in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example accelerometer measurements for one participant (Ellis et al., 2014)."}
knitr::include_graphics('images/ellis2014_accelerometer.png')
```

- Activity categories: aerobic (e.g. walking, running, basketball), household (e.g. laundry), vehicle

## Traditional Method for Classifying Activity Type
Cut-point

- e.g. sedentary (< 100 CPM), light (100 – 1951 CPM), moderate to vigorous physical activity (>= 1952 CPM) (Ellis et al., 2016)
  - CPM: counts per minute (proprietary accelerometer metric) 

## Common Machine Learning Models
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Network (NN)
- **Random Forest (RF)**
- 75 - 95% accuracy

## Support Vector Machine
```{r, out.height='40%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/svm_2d.png', dpi = NA)
```

```{r, out.height='40%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/svm_3d.png', dpi = NA)
```
- Feature augmentation

## Neural Network
```{r, out.height='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/nn.png', dpi = NA)
```

- Can represent complex relationships between features
  - Linear function ($W\mathbf{x}$)
  - Nonlinear (activation) function, e.g. ReLU: $f(a) = max(0, a)$

## Random Forest
```{r, out.height='30%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/tree.png', dpi = NA)
```

```{r, out.height='40%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/rf.png', dpi = NA)
```

- Generalization
- Feature importance
- Successful with minor hyperparameter tuning

## Features
```{r, out.height='70%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example feature importance for a random forest classifier (Ellis et al., 2016)."}
knitr::include_graphics('images/ellis2016_features.png', dpi = NA)
```

## Features
```{r, out.width='75%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Pitch, yaw and roll."}
knitr::include_graphics('images/pitchYawRoll.jpg')
```

## HR Feature
- "Maximum HR was estimated for each participant by maxHR = 220 - age." (Ellis et al, 2014, p. 2195)
- Classification performance did _not_ improve

## Evaluation
```{r, out.width='90%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example confusion matrix, where the true labels are on the rows and the predicted labels are on the columns (Ellis et al., 2016)."}
knitr::include_graphics('images/ellis2016_confusion.png')
```

- Leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation
- Precision: TP/(TP+FP)
- Recall: TP/(TP+FN)
- F-score: $\frac{2*\text{precision} * \text{recall}}{(\text{precision} + \text{recall})}$

## Participants and Controlled vs Free-Living
"the high predictive accuracy of laboratory-calibrated models has not been reproducible in free-living settings." (Farrahi et al., 2019)

- Ellis et al. (2014): lab environment
- Staudenmayer et al. (2015): "as similar to free-living conditions (e.g., gardening and raking were performed outside and basketball was performed in a gym on a court) as possible." (p. 397)
- Ellis et al. (2016): free-living training measurements + labels via wearable camera

## Gaps
- Classify strength/resistance vs aerobic
- Fitbit data
- Feature engineering informed by background literature and EDA
  - Personalized HR features
- Hybrid controlled and free-living conditions for training data collection

## Feature Engineering Brainstorm
Build a machine learning model for classifying aerobic vs strength using wrist-worn, PPG-based Fitbit Charge 2 data.

Potential Features for a Random Forest Model

- rolling window summary functions for number of steps
- rolling window summary functions for HR
  - Rate of increase
- $HR - RHR_{est}$
  - RHR estimation model or clinical RHR measurements (supine, sitting, standing)
