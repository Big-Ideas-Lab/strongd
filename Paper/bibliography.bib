	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}— Individuals with impaired glucose tolerance ({IGT}) have a high risk of developing {NIDDM}. The purpose of this study was to determine whether diet and exercise interventions in those with {IGT} may delay the development of {NIDDM}, i.e., reduce the incidence of {NIDDM}, and thereby reduce the overall incidence of diabetic complications, such as cardiovascular, renal, and retinal disease, and the excess mortality attributable to these complications. {RESEARCH} {DESIGN} A N D M E T H O D S — In 1986,110,660 men and women from 33 health care clinics in the city of Da Qing, China, were screened for {IGT} and {NIDDM}. Of these individuals, 577 were classified (using World Health Organization criteria) as having {IGT}. Subjects were randomized by clinic into a clinical trial, either to a control group or to one of three active treatment groups: diet only, exercise only, or diet plus exercise. Follow-up evaluation examinations were conducted at 2-year intervals over a 6-year period to identify subjects who developed {NIDDM}. Cox's proportional hazard analysis was used to determine if the incidence of {NIDDM} varied by treatment assignment.
{RESULTS} — The cumulative incidence of diabetes at 6 years was 67.7\% (95\% {CI}, 59.8-75.2) in the control group compared with 43.8\% (95\% {CI}, 35.5-52.3) in the diet group, 41.1\% (95\% {CI}, 33.4-49.4) in the exercise group, and 46.0\% (95\% {CI}, 37.3-54.7) in the diet-plus-exercise group (P {\textless} 0.05). When analyzed by clinic, each of the active intervention groups differed significantly from the control clinics (P {\textless} 0.05). The relative decrease in rate of development of diabetes in the active treatment groups was similar when subjects were stratified as lean or overweight ({BMI} {\textless} or {\textgreater}25 kg/m2). In a proportional hazards analysis adjusted for differences in baseline {BMI} and fasting glucose, the diet, exercise, and diet-plus-exercise interventions were associated with 31\% (P {\textless} 0.03), 46\% (P {\textless} 0.0005), and 42\% (P {\textless} 0.005) reductions in risk of developing diabetes, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS} — Diet and/or exercise interventions led to a significant decrease in the incidence of diabetes over a 6-year period among those with {IGT}.},

{RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS} Overweight and obese individuals with {IGT} were recruited from ongoing screening studies at the University Hospitals of Leicester, U.K. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Group 1 received a 3-h group-based structured education program designed to promote walking activity using personalized steps-per-day goals and pedometers. Group 2 received a 3-h group-based structured education program designed to promote walking activity using generic time-based goals. Group 3 received a brief information leaflet (control condition). Outcomes included an oral glucose tolerance test, standard anthropometric measures, ambulatory activity, and psychological variables. Follow-up was conducted at 3, 6, and 12 months.
{RESULTS} A total of 87 individuals (66\% male, mean age 65 years) were included in this study. At 12 months, significant decreases in 2-h postchallenge glucose and fasting glucose of −1.31 mmol/l (95\% {CI} −2.20 to −0.43) and −0.32 mmol/l (−0.59 to −0.03), respectively, were seen in the pedometer group compared with the control group. No significant improvements in glucose control were seen in those given the standard education program.
{CONCLUSIONS} This study suggests that a pragmatic structured education program that incorporates pedometer use is effective for improving glucose tolerance in those with {IGT}. This result is likely to have important implications for future primary care–based diabetes prevention initiatives.},

Symptoms and signs of {ANS} dysfunction, such as resting heart rate elevations, diminished blood pressure responses to standing, and altered time and frequency domain measures of heart rate variability in response to deep breathing, standing, and the Valsalva maneuver, should be elicited from all patients with diabetes and prediabetes. With the recognition of the presence of {ANS} imbalance or for its prevention, a rigorous regime should be implemented with lifestyle modification, physical activity, and cautious use of medications that lower blood glucose. Rather than intensifying diabetes control, a regimen tailored to the individual risk of autonomic imbalance should be implemented. New agents that may improve autonomic function, such as {SGLT}2 inhibitors, should be considered and the use of incretins monitored. One of the central mechanisms of dysfunction is disturbance of the hypothalamic cardiac clock, a consequence of dopamine deficiency that leads to sympathetic dominance, insulin resistance, and features of the metabolic syndrome. An improvement in {ANS} balance may be critical to reducing cardiovascular events, cardiac failure, and early mortality in the diabetic population.},

Participants in these trials consumed a low-fat diet, lost a moderate amount of weight and/or increased their physical activity. Weight loss appears to be the primary driver of type 2 diabetes risk reduction, with individual dietary components playing a minor role. The effect of weight loss via other dietary approaches, such as low-carbohydrate diets, a Mediterranean dietary pattern, intermittent fasting or very-low-energy diets, on the incidence of type 2 diabetes has not been tested. These diets-as described here-could be equally, if not more effective in preventing type 2 diabetes than the tested low-fat diet, and if so, would increase choice for patients. There is also a need to understand the effect of foods and diets on beta-cell function, as the available evidence suggests moderate weight loss, as achieved in the diabetes prevention trials, improves insulin sensitivity but not beta-cell function. Finally, prediabetes is an umbrella term for different prediabetic states, each with distinct underlying pathophysiology.

	doi = {10.1016/j.amepre.2018.04.038},
	abstract = {{CONTEXT}: Prediabetes is prevalent and significantly increases lifetime risk of progression to type 2 diabetes. This review summarizes the evidence surrounding metformin use for type 2 diabetes prevention.
{EVIDENCE} {ACQUISITION}: Articles published between 1998 and 2017 examining metformin use for the primary indication of diabetes prevention available on {MEDLINE}.
{EVIDENCE} {SYNTHESIS}: Forty articles met inclusion criteria and were summarized into four general categories: (1) {RCTs} of metformin use for diabetes prevention (n=7 and n=2 follow-up analyses); (2) observational analyses examining metformin use in heterogeneous subgroups of patients with prediabetes (n=9 from the Diabetes Prevention Program, n=1 from the biguanides and the prevention of the risk of obesity [{BIGPRO}] trial); (3) observational analyses examining cost effectiveness of metformin use for diabetes prevention (n=11 from the Diabetes Prevention Program, n=1 from the Indian Diabetes Prevention Program); and (4) real-world assessments of metformin eligibility or use for diabetes prevention (n=9). Metformin was associated with reduced relative risk of incident diabetes, with the strongest evidence for use in those at highest risk (i.e., aged {\textless}60 years, {BMI} ≥35, and women with histories of gestational diabetes). Metformin was also deemed cost effective in 11 economic analyses. Recent studies highlighted low rates of metformin use for diabetes prevention in real-world settings.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Two decades of evidence support metformin use for diabetes prevention among higher-risk patients. However, metformin is not widely used in real-world practice, and enhancing the translation of this evidence to real-world practice has important implications for patients, providers, and payers.},

	abstract = {{AIMS}: To assess the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of lifestyle intervention, compared with treatment as usual in people with prediabetes as defined by the American Diabetes Association. For older studies, we used the 1985 World Health Organization definition.
{METHODS}: We systematically searched multiple electronic databases and referenced lists of pertinent review articles from January 1980 through November 2015. We performed an update search in {MEDLINE} on April 26, 2017. Based on a priori established eligibility criteria, we dually reviewed the literature, extracted data, and rated the risk of bias of included studies with validated checklists. To assess the efficacy of lifestyle intervention to prevent or delay further progression to type 2 diabetes, we conducted a random-effects meta-analysis. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the {GRADE} (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.
{RESULT}: Pooled results of 16 randomized controlled trials showed that people with prediabetes who received lifestyle intervention had a lower rate of progression to type 2 diabetes after one (4\% vs. 10\%, {RR} 0.46 [{CI} 0.32, 0.66]) and three years of follow-up (14\% vs. 23\%, {RR} 0.64 [95\% {CI} 0.53, 0.77]). The majority of the studies also showed a greater weight loss in lifestyle intervention participants, with a great variation between studies. Costs per quality-adjusted life-year were lower when the benefits of lifestyle intervention were analyzed over a lifelong time horizon compared to only the period of lifestyle intervention (three years) or to modeling over a ten-year period.
{CONCLUSION}: Lifestyle intervention is an efficacious, safe, and cost-effective measure to reduce the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes in people diagnosed with prediabetes. More research is necessary to compare the efficacy of various modes, frequencies, and intensities of lifestyle intervention across studies.},

This narrative review examines the evidence and, more importantly, identifies the sources of such inter-individual variability. In doing so, this review highlights that no randomized controlled trial of exercise has yet prospectively measured inter-individual variability in blood glucose control in individuals with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. Of the identified sources of inter-individual variability, neither has a prospective randomized controlled trial yet quantified the impact of exercise dose, exercise frequency, exercise type, behavioral/environmental barriers, exercise-meal timing, or anti-hyperglycemic drugs on changes in blood glucose control, in individuals with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. In addition, there is also an urgent need for prospective trials to identify molecular or physiological predictors of inter-individual variability in the changes in blood glucose control following exercise. Therefore, the narrative identifies critical science gaps that must be filled if exercise scientists are to succeed in optimizing health care policy recommendations for type 2 diabetes, so that the therapeutic benefit of exercise may be maximized for all individuals with, or at risk of, diabetes.},

{RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS} {PubMed}, Embase, Cochrane Library, and {ClinicalTrials}.gov were searched for studies published between January 1990 and April 2015. Effectiveness/translation studies of any design testing {LSM} strategies, targeting high-risk populations (with prediabetes or diabetes risk factors), and reporting diabetes incidence, weight, or glucose outcomes were included. We extracted number of diabetes cases/incidence rates and mean changes in weight (kg), fasting blood glucose ({FBG}, mmol/L), 2-h postload glucose (mmol/L), and hemoglobin A1c (\%). Pairwise random-effects and frequentist random-effects network meta-analyses were used to obtain pooled effects.
{RESULTS} Sixty-three studies were pooled in the meta-analysis (n = 17,272, mean age 49.7 years, 28.8\% male, 60.8\% white/European). In analyses restricted to controlled studies (n = 7), diabetes cumulative incidence was 9\% among intervention participants and 12\% among control participants (absolute risk reduction 3\%; relative risk 0.71 [95\% {CI} 0.58, 0.88]). In analyses combining controlled and uncontrolled studies (n = 14), participants receiving group education by health care professionals had 33\% lower diabetes odds than control participants (odds ratio 0.67 [0.49, 0.92]). Intervention participants lost 1.5 kg more weight [−2.2, −0.8] and achieved a 0.09 mmol/L greater {FBG} decrease [−0.15, −0.03] than control participants. Every additional kilogram lost by participants was associated with 43\% lower diabetes odds (β = 0.57 [0.41, 0.78]).

	abstract = {The adoption and maintenance of physical activity are critical foci for blood glucose management and overall health in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes. Recommendations and precautions vary depending on individual characteristics and health status. In this Position Statement, we provide a clinically oriented review and evidence-based recommendations regarding physical activity and exercise in people with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus, and prediabetes.

Physical activity includes all movement that increases energy use, whereas exercise is planned, structured physical activity. Exercise improves blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes, reduces cardiovascular risk factors, contributes to weight loss, and improves well-being (1,2). Regular exercise may prevent or delay type 2 diabetes development (3). Regular exercise also has considerable health benefits for people with type 1 diabetes (e.g., improved cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, insulin sensitivity, etc.) (4). The challenges related to blood glucose management vary with diabetes type, activity type, and presence of diabetes-related complications (5,6). Physical activity and exercise recommendations, therefore, should be tailored to meet the specific needs of each individual.

Physical activity recommendations and precautions may vary by diabetes type. The primary types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes (5\%–10\% of cases) results from cellular-mediated autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic β-cells, producing insulin deficiency (7). Although it can occur at any age, β-cell destruction rates vary, typically occurring more rapidly in youth than in adults. Type 2 diabetes (90\%–95\% of cases) results from a progressive loss of insulin secretion, usually also with insulin resistance. Gestational diabetes mellitus occurs during pregnancy, with screening typically occurring at 24–28 weeks of gestation in pregnant women not previously known to have diabetes. Prediabetes is diagnosed when blood glucose levels are above the normal range but not high enough to be classified as …},

	abstract = {Background
Personal Activity Intelligence ({PAI}) is a novel activity metric that translates heart rate variations during exercise into a weekly score. Weekly {PAI} scores assessed at a single point in time were found to associate with lower risk of premature cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) mortality in the general healthy population. However, to date, the associations between long-term longitudinal changes in weekly {PAI} scores and mortality have not been explored.
Purpose
The aim of the present study was to prospectively examine the association between change in weekly {PAI} scores estimated 10 years apart, and risk of mortality from {CVD} and all-causes.
Methods
We performed a prospective cohort study of 11,870 men and 13,010 women without known {CVD} in Norway. By using data from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study ({HUNT}), {PAI} was estimated twice, ten years apart ({HUNT}1 1984-86 and {HUNT}2 1995-97). Mortality was followed-up until December 31, 2015. Adjusted hazard ratios ({AHR}) and 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) for death from {CVD} and all-causes related to temporal changes in {PAI} were estimated using Cox regression analyses.
Results
During a mean ({SD}) of 18 (4) years of follow-up, there were 4782 deaths, including 1560 deaths caused by {CVD}. Multi-adjusted analyses demonstrated that participants achieving a score of ≥100 {PAI} at both time points had 32\% lower risk of {CVD} mortality ({AHR} 0.68; {CI}: 0.54–0.86) for {CVD} mortality and 20\% lower risk of all-cause mortality ({AHR} 0.80; {CI}: 71–0.91) compared with participants obtaining {\textless}100 weekly {PAI} at both measurements. For participants having {\textless}100 {PAI} in {HUNT}1 but ≥100 {PAI} in {HUNT}2, the {AHRs} were 0.87 ({CI}: 0.74–1.03) for {CVD} mortality, and 0.86 ({CI}: 0.79–0.95) for all-cause mortality. We also found an inverse linear relationship between change in {PAI} and risk of {CVD} mortality among participants with 0 {PAI} (P {\textless} 0.01), and ≤50 {PAI} (P = 0.04) in {HUNT}1, indicating that an increase in {PAI} over time is associated with lower risk of mortality. Excluding the first three years of follow-up did not substantially alter the findings. Increasing {PAI} score from {\textless}100 {PAI} in {HUNT}1 to ≥100 {PAI} in {HUNT}2 was associated with 6.6 years gained lifespan.
Conclusion
Among men and women without known {CVD}, an increase in {PAI} score and sustained high {PAI} score over a 10-year period was associated with lower risk of mortality.},

	abstract = {Objective To examine the effects of short-term, medium-term and long-term resistance exercise training ({RET}) on measures of cardiometabolic health in adults.
Design Intervention systematic review.
Data sources {MEDLINE} and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception to February 2018. The search strategy included the following keywords: resistance exercise, strength training and randomised controlled trial.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials published in English comparing {RET}≥2 weeks in duration with a non-exercising control or usual care group. Participants were non-athletic and aged ≥18 years.
Results A total of 173 trials were included. Medium-term and long-term {RET} reduced systolic blood pressure (−4.02 (95\% {CI} −5.92 to −2.11) mm Hg, p{\textless}0.0001 and −5.08 (−10.04 to –0.13) mm Hg, p=0.04, respectively) and diastolic blood pressure (−1.73 (−2.88 to –0.57) mm Hg, p=0.003 and −4.93 (−8.58 to –1.28) mm Hg, p=0.008, respectively) versus control. Medium-term {RET} elicited reductions in fasted insulin and insulin resistance (−0.59 (−0.97 to –0.21) µU/{mL}, p=0.002 and −1.22 (−2.29 to –0.15) µU/{mL}, p=0.02, respectively). The effects were greater in those with elevated cardiometabolic risk or disease compared with younger healthy adults. The quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. There was limited evidence of adverse events.
Conclusions {RET} may be effective for inducing improvements in cardio metabolic health outcomes in healthy adults and those with an adverse cardio metabolic risk profile.
